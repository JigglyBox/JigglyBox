# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kathleen!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and hands-on developer with a strong foundation in **C++** and **game development**. I enjoy building systems from scratch — from low-level game engines to gameplay mechanics and UI tooling.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎮 Currently working on a **3D Third-Person Shooter** game set in an **olden-day Singapore**, where a delivery robot uncovers humanity’s last hope.
- 🛠️ Building a custom **2D/3D game engine** in C++ with features like:
  - Logger system with customizable log types and layers
  - ImGui-based console and editor tools
  - Undo/redo via the command pattern
  - Node editor integration (ImGui Node Editor)
  - 💡 Also experienced with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** for rapid prototyping and gameplay scripting
